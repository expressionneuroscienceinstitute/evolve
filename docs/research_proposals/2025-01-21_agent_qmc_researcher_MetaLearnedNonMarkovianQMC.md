# Research Proposal: Meta-Learned Non-Markovian Adaptive Quantum Monte Carlo

**Date:** 2025-01-21  
**Agent:** agent_qmc_researcher  
**Feature:** Meta-Learned Non-Markovian Adaptive QMC  
**Status:** PROPOSED  

## 1. Problem Statement

### 1.1 Current Limitations in QMC
Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods face several fundamental challenges that limit their effectiveness for complex quantum systems:

1. **Markovian Sampling Limitations**: Traditional QMC relies on local, Markovian moves that can become trapped in local minima or metastable states, especially in systems with rough energy landscapes, glassy behavior, or multiple competing phases.

2. **Fixed Proposal Distributions**: Current methods use hand-tuned or simple adaptive proposal distributions that do not leverage the rich information available during sampling about the energy landscape structure.

3. **Inefficient Exploration**: Standard QMC lacks mechanisms to actively identify and sample regions of high uncertainty, rare events, or phase transitions, leading to poor convergence for challenging systems.

4. **No Meta-Optimization**: QMC algorithms themselves are not optimized during execution - their hyperparameters and strategies remain fixed throughout the simulation.

### 1.2 Novel Research Opportunity
We propose developing **Meta-Learned Non-Markovian Adaptive QMC (ML-NMA-QMC)**, a fundamentally new approach that addresses all these limitations through:

- **Non-Markovian Walkers**: Each walker maintains explicit memory of its trajectory history
- **Meta-Learned Proposals**: Online learning of optimal proposal distributions using information-theoretic criteria
- **Active Learning Integration**: Directing sampling to regions of highest uncertainty in the energy landscape
- **Non-Local Teleportation Moves**: Controlled breaking of detailed balance to escape local minima
- **Self-Optimizing Algorithm**: Meta-optimization of QMC parameters during execution

## 2. Literature Review

### 2.1 Current State of QMC Optimization (2023-2024)

**Recent Advances:**
- **Wasserstein QMC (WQMC)**: Uses Wasserstein gradient flows instead of Fisher-Rao, achieving faster convergence ([NeurIPS 2023](https://openreview.net/forum?id=pjSzKhSrfs))
- **Quadratic QVMC (Q²VMC)**: Discretizes imaginary-time evolution with quadratic updates for improved stability ([NeurIPS 2024](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2024/file/27666e699d9a94540fac44eae955d8ed-Paper-Conference.pdf))
- **Quantum-Enhanced VMC (QEVMC)**: Uses VQE samples as initial states to accelerate convergence ([arXiv:2307.07719](https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2307.07719v1.pdf))
- **Error-Resilient QMC**: Robust to quantum hardware errors using random evolution times ([Quantum 2023](https://quantum-journal.org/papers/q-2023-02-09-916/))

**Gaps in Current Literature:**
- All methods remain fundamentally **Markovian** - no explicit memory of walker history
- Proposal distributions are **fixed or simply adaptive** - no online learning of optimal proposals
- No **active learning** integration to identify high-uncertainty regions
- No **meta-optimization** of the QMC algorithm itself during execution
- No **non-local moves** guided by learned models of the energy landscape

## 3. Technical Approach

### 3.1 Core Innovation: Memory-Augmented Walkers

**Memory Representation:**
```rust
struct MemoryAugmentedWalker {
    position: Vec<Vector3<f64>>,
    weight: f64,
    local_energy: f64,
    // Novel: Explicit memory of trajectory
    trajectory_memory: TrajectoryMemory,
    // Novel: Learned proposal model
    proposal_model: ProposalModel,
    // Novel: Uncertainty estimates
    uncertainty_estimate: f64,
}

struct TrajectoryMemory {
    // Compressed history using attention mechanism
    attention_weights: Vec<f64>,
    key_positions: Vec<Vec<Vector3<f64>>>,
    value_energies: Vec<f64>,
    // Temporal correlation structure
    autocorrelation_features: Vec<f64>,
    // Phase space exploration metrics
    exploration_metrics: ExplorationMetrics,
}
```

### 3.2 Meta-Learned Proposal Distributions

**Information-Theoretic Learning:**
```rust
struct ProposalModel {
    // Neural network for proposal generation
    proposal_network: NeuralNetwork,
    // Uncertainty quantification
    uncertainty_estimator: UncertaintyEstimator,
    // Active learning criteria
    information_gain_calculator: InformationGainCalculator,
}

impl ProposalModel {
    fn propose_move(&mut self, walker: &MemoryAugmentedWalker) -> Vec<Vector3<f64>> {
        // Use learned model to propose optimal move
        let proposal = self.proposal_network.forward(&walker.trajectory_memory);
        
        // Apply uncertainty-based exploration
        let exploration_noise = self.uncertainty_estimator.sample_exploration();
        
        // Combine learned proposal with exploration
        proposal + exploration_noise
    }
    
    fn update_model(&mut self, walker: &MemoryAugmentedWalker, acceptance: bool, energy_change: f64) {
        // Online learning of proposal distribution
        let information_gain = self.calculate_information_gain(walker, energy_change);
        let learning_signal = if acceptance { information_gain } else { -information_gain };
        
        self.proposal_network.update(learning_signal);
    }
}
```

### 3.3 Active Learning Integration

**Uncertainty-Driven Sampling:**
```rust
struct ActiveLearningController {
    // Energy landscape uncertainty map
    uncertainty_map: UncertaintyMap,
    // Rare event detector
    rare_event_detector: RareEventDetector,
    // Phase transition identifier
    phase_transition_detector: PhaseTransitionDetector,
}

impl ActiveLearningController {
    fn identify_high_uncertainty_regions(&self, walkers: &[MemoryAugmentedWalker]) -> Vec<usize> {
        // Find regions where energy landscape is poorly understood
        walkers.iter()
            .enumerate()
            .filter(|(_, w)| w.uncertainty_estimate > self.uncertainty_threshold)
            .map(|(i, _)| i)
            .collect()
    }
    
    fn direct_sampling(&mut self, walkers: &mut [MemoryAugmentedWalker]) {
        // Redirect walkers to high-uncertainty regions
        let high_uncertainty_indices = self.identify_high_uncertainty_regions(walkers);
        
        for &idx in &high_uncertainty_indices {
            // Increase sampling weight for uncertain regions
            walkers[idx].weight *= self.uncertainty_boost_factor;
        }
    }
}
```

### 3.4 Non-Local Teleportation Moves

**Controlled Breaking of Detailed Balance:**
```rust
struct TeleportationController {
    // Learned energy landscape model
    energy_landscape_model: EnergyLandscapeModel,
    // Teleportation probability scheduler
    teleportation_scheduler: TeleportationScheduler,
    // Acceptance criteria for non-local moves
    acceptance_criteria: NonLocalAcceptanceCriteria,
}

impl TeleportationController {
    fn attempt_teleportation(&mut self, walker: &mut MemoryAugmentedWalker) -> bool {
        // Estimate probability of beneficial teleportation
        let teleport_prob = self.teleportation_scheduler.get_probability();
        
        if rand::random::<f64>() < teleport_prob {
            // Generate teleportation target using learned model
            let target_position = self.energy_landscape_model.sample_promising_region();
            
            // Calculate acceptance probability for non-local move
            let acceptance = self.calculate_teleportation_acceptance(walker, &target_position);
            
            if acceptance {
                walker.position = target_position;
                return true;
            }
        }
        false
    }
}
```

### 3.5 Meta-Optimization Framework

**Self-Optimizing QMC Algorithm:**
```rust
struct MetaOptimizer {
    // Reinforcement learning agent for algorithm optimization
    rl_agent: RLAgent,
    // Performance metrics tracker
    performance_tracker: PerformanceTracker,
    // Hyperparameter space
    hyperparameter_space: HyperparameterSpace,
}

impl MetaOptimizer {
    fn optimize_algorithm(&mut self, current_performance: &PerformanceMetrics) {
        // Get current state (performance metrics, convergence status)
        let state = self.performance_tracker.get_state();
        
        // RL agent suggests algorithm modifications
        let action = self.rl_agent.select_action(&state);
        
        // Apply suggested modifications
        self.apply_algorithm_modifications(action);
        
        // Update RL agent with new performance
        let reward = self.calculate_reward(current_performance);
        self.rl_agent.update(state, action, reward);
    }
}
```
