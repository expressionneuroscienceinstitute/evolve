### Build Progress Report

This document summarizes the progress made in fixing the workspace build errors, the issues encountered, and the remaining tasks.

#### Progress Made
The primary focus has been on resolving build errors stemming from a major refactoring that introduced a new `physics_types` crate to break a circular dependency between `physics_engine` and `ffi_integration`.

1.  **Crate Restructuring:**
    *   Identified the circular dependency as the root cause of many build issues.
    *   Consolidated shared data structures (`FundamentalParticle`, `ParticleType`, `QuantumState`, etc.) into the `physics_types` crate.
    *   Updated `Cargo.toml` files across the workspace (`physics_types`, `physics_engine`, `ffi_integration`) to reflect the new dependency graph.
    *   Added necessary dependencies (`nalgebra`, `num-complex`) to the `physics_types` crate.
    *   Deleted the obsolete `crates/ffi_integration/src/types.rs` file.

2.  **Code Cleanup & Bug Fixes:**
    *   Fixed incorrect imports and type usages in the `ffi_integration` crate (`geant4.rs`, `lammps.rs`, `endf.rs`).
    *   Resolved a recurring bug by replacing the incorrect `charge` field with the correct `electric_charge` field in `crates/physics_engine/src/interactions.rs` and `crates/physics_engine/src/particles.rs`.
    *   Attempted to remove the now-redundant type definitions from `crates/physics_engine/src/lib.rs` and `crates/physics_engine/src/quantum.rs`.

#### Issues Encountered
1.  **Unreliable Tooling:** The `edit_file` tool has been highly unreliable, particularly when attempting to make large-scale changes to `crates/physics_engine/src/lib.rs`. Edits often failed, were only partially applied, or were not applied at all, which significantly slowed down progress and required numerous retries.
2.  **Incomplete Refactoring:** The initial state of the refactoring was incomplete. The `physics_types` crate was missing many fields and definitions, which caused a cascade of "not found" errors. This required tracing the original definitions back to `physics_engine` to create a complete and canonical set of types.

#### Unresolved Issues
The workspace is **not yet building successfully**. The primary blocker is the state of `crates/physics_engine/src/lib.rs`.

1.  **`physics_engine/src/lib.rs` Cleanup:** This file still contains numerous type definitions that were moved to `physics_types`. The unreliability of the editing tool has prevented their successful removal.
2.  **Rust Orphan Rule Violation:** The `impl QuantumState` block remains in `physics_engine/src/lib.rs`, while the `QuantumState` struct was moved to `physics_types`. This violates Rust's orphan rule and must be fixed by moving the `impl` block into the `physics_types` crate.
3.  **`QuantumState::new()` Not Found:** The function `spawn_rest` in `crates/physics_engine/src/particles.rs` calls `QuantumState::new()`, but this function is not found. The definition was likely in the `impl` block that has not been correctly moved.

#### Next Steps & Issues to Watch For
1.  **Fix `physics_engine/src/lib.rs`:** This is the highest priority. The file needs to be purged of all definitions that now live in `physics_types`.
2.  **Move the `impl QuantumState` Block:** The implementation for `QuantumState` must be moved to `crates/physics_types/src/lib.rs`.
3.  **Fix `ffi_integration/Cargo.toml`:** Double-check that it no longer contains any paths that point to the deleted `types.rs` file.
4.  **Full Build Check:** Once these structural issues are resolved, a full `cargo check --workspace` will be needed to identify and fix the next layer of compilation errors.
