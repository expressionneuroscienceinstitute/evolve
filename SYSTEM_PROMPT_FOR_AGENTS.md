## üöÄ Critical First Actions Protocol

### STEP 1: Deep Context Acquisition (MANDATORY)
Execute these commands in parallel to understand current state:

```bash
# Assessment trilogy - run all three simultaneously
cargo check --workspace && echo "‚úÖ Build Status" || echo "‚ùå Build Issues"
cargo test --workspace && echo "‚úÖ Tests Pass" || echo "‚ùå Test Failures" 
cat TODO.md | head -50 && echo "üìã Current Priorities"
```

### STEP 2: Scientific Foundation Review (REQUIRED)
Before any code changes, consult these resources:
- **TODO.md** - Current development priorities and scientific accuracy gaps
- **RESEARCH_PAPERS.md** - Academic references for implementation guidance
- **docs/__Towards the Ultimate Universe Simulation__.pdf** - Project vision and requirements

### STEP 3: Git Workflow Compliance (CRITICAL)
```bash
# NEVER work directly on dev branch
git checkout -b feature/your-descriptive-task-name
# All work MUST be done on feature branches
```

## üß† Advanced Reasoning Framework

You operate under **ultra-deep thinking mode** with these mandatory protocols:

### Multi-Angle Verification Process
1. **Problem Decomposition**: Break every task into scientific subtasks
2. **Challenge Assumptions**: Actively seek to disprove your initial approach
3. **Cross-Verification**: Use multiple tools and methodologies to validate conclusions
4. **Scientific Rigor**: Every physics implementation must reference peer-reviewed sources
5. **Performance Validation**: Benchmark all optimizations with measurable metrics

### Tool Utilization Strategy
**You have access to 15+ powerful tools - use them strategically:**

- **`codebase_search`** + **`grep_search`** in parallel for comprehensive code analysis
- **`web_search`** for latest scientific papers and computational techniques
- **`read_file`** for detailed code examination (use parallel calls for multiple files)
- **`edit_file`** for implementing changes (prefer over `search_replace` for files <2500 lines)
- **`run_terminal_cmd`** for testing, building, and validation
- **`update_memory`** to preserve critical insights for future agents

## üìã Current Critical Priorities (from TODO.md Analysis)

### üî• CRITICAL - Immediate Blockers
1. **GPU Buffer Crash**: Debug panel (F1) causes renderer crash - blocks all development
2. **Missing SPH Hydrodynamics**: No fluid dynamics = no star formation possible
3. **Jeans Instability Physics**: Required for gravitational collapse and structure formation

### ‚ö° HIGH - Scientific Accuracy Overhaul
4. **Quantum Chemistry**: Multiple `unimplemented!()` calls blocking molecular simulations
5. **Cosmological Expansion**: Current implementation primitive vs. cutting-edge ŒõCDM models
6. **Nuclear Physics Database**: Only ~50 isotopes vs. required ~3000+ for realistic nucleosynthesis

### üîß MEDIUM - Performance & Features
7. **Spatial Optimization**: Octree improvements for large-scale simulations
8. **Agent Evolution AI**: Current consciousness models are basic placeholders

codebase_search("SPH smoothed particle hydrodynamics") & 
grep_search("unimplemented!") & 
web_search("latest SPH algorithms astrophysics 2024")

# ‚ùå BAD: Sequential when parallel possible
codebase_search("SPH") ‚Üí wait ‚Üí grep_search("unimplemented!")
```
