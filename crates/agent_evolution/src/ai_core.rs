//! # Agent Evolution: AI Core
//!
//! This module defines the core intelligence of an agent, including its neural network,
//! sensory processing, and decision-making capabilities. The AI core is designed to be
//! modular and extensible, allowing for different neural architectures and learning algorithms.
