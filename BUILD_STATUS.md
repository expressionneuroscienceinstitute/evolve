# Build Status Summary

## Fixed Issues ✅

### 1. Missing Constants
- Added `COULOMB_CONSTANT` and `MEV_TO_J` to constants.rs
- Fixed imports in quantum_chemistry.rs to use the new constants
- Fixed `speed_of_light` → `c` field reference in electromagnetic.rs

### 2. Duplicate Function Definitions
- Removed duplicate `calculate_bond_force_physics` from lib.rs (kept the one in molecular_helpers.rs)
- Fixed function signature conflicts

### 3. Type Annotation Issues
- Fixed ambiguous numeric types by adding explicit type annotations:
  - `dt: f64` in electromagnetic.rs
  - `characteristic_length: f64` in geodynamics.rs
  - `epsilon_mixed: f64` in molecular_helpers.rs
  - `6.62607015e-34_f64` in lib.rs

### 4. Complex Number Multiplication
- Fixed FFT gradient calculation by separating complex `i` from Vector3 multiplication

### 5. Core Graphics Issue Workaround
- Identified that the `core-graphics-types` error comes from `native_renderer` dependency
- This is a macOS-specific framework being linked on Linux
- Can be avoided by building without the `native_renderer` feature

## Remaining Build Errors ❌

### 1. Borrow Checker Issues (Major)
- Multiple mutable/immutable borrow conflicts in lib.rs
- Entanglement partner iteration causing simultaneous borrows
- Molecular dynamics loop borrowing issues

### 2. Missing Methods
- `Atom::ionize()` method not found
- `Atom::spectral_emission()` method not found  
- `Atom::charge()` method not found
- Various `FundamentalParticle` methods being called as if it returns `Result<T>`

### 3. Type Mismatches
- `atomic_physics::Atom` vs `crate::Atom` confusion
- `ConservationLaw` reference/value mismatch

### 4. Memory Management
- Several `use of moved value` errors
- Missing `Clone` implementations for some types

## Current Build Command
```bash
cargo build --bin universectl --features heavy --no-default-features
```

This avoids the core-graphics issue but still has ~40 remaining errors in physics_engine.

## Next Steps
1. Fix borrow checker issues by restructuring problematic loops
2. Implement missing methods on Atom and FundamentalParticle
3. Resolve type confusion between different Atom types
4. Add necessary Clone implementations
5. Fix remaining memory management issues

The physics_engine crate now compiles the quantum chemistry and molecular dynamics code successfully, with most errors being in the higher-level simulation logic.
