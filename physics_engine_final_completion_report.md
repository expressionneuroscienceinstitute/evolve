## Technical Achievements

### 1. Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) - E0499 Fixed âœ…
**Problem**: Double mutable borrow on `self.cells` in refinement operations
**Solution**: Implemented extract-before-mutate pattern
- Phase 1: Extract all needed parent cell data (level, position, size, boundary conditions, refinement criterion)  
- Phase 2: Update parent cell properties
- Phase 3: Create child cells using extracted data
- Phase 4: Update parent's children list
- Phase 5: Record refinement events

**Technical Pattern**: Multi-phase extraction to avoid overlapping borrows
```rust
// Phase 1: Extract all needed data before any mutations
let (parent_level, parent_pos, parent_size, boundary_conditions, refinement_criterion) = {
    // Safe immutable access
};
// Phase 2+: Use extracted data for all mutations
```

### 2. Cosmological SPH Feedback - E0499 Fixed âœ…
**Problem**: Overlapping mutable borrows during star formation and feedback application
**Solution**: Event collection pattern
- Phase 1: Collect star formation events during particle iteration
- Phase 2: Apply feedback after iteration completes
- Eliminates simultaneous mutable access to particles array

**Technical Pattern**: Deferred mutation via event collection
```rust
// Collect events first
let mut star_formation_events = Vec::new();
for (i, particle) in particles.iter_mut().enumerate() {
    // ... collect events
    star_formation_events.push((i, star_mass));
}
// Apply events after iteration
for (particle_idx, star_mass) in star_formation_events {
    self.feedback.apply_supernova_feedback(particles, particle_idx, star_mass);
}
```

### 3. Molecular Dynamics Energy - E0502 Fixed âœ…
**Problem**: Immutable method call during mutable molecule iteration
**Solution**: Pre-calculation pattern
- Extract atomic energies before mutable borrow of molecules
- Use pre-calculated values during mutation phase
- Maintains energy conservation while avoiding borrow conflicts

**Technical Pattern**: Pre-calculation to separate immutable and mutable access
```rust
// Pre-calculate atomic energies before mutable borrow
let atomic_energies: Vec<f64> = if let Some(molecule) = self.molecules.get(mol_idx) {
    molecule.atoms.iter()
        .map(|atom| self.get_atomic_energy(&atom.nucleus.atomic_number))
        .collect()
} else {
    Vec::new()
};
// Use pre-calculated values during mutable operations
```

### 4. Neural Physics Type Resolution âœ…
**Problem**: Missing type definitions for `LearningPhase` and `PlasticityEvent`
**Solution**: Proper module imports and type resolution
- Added explicit imports from `neural_plasticity` module
- Fixed type mismatch in layer size comparison (dereference issue)
- Resolved import conflicts and duplicate declarations

## Established Technical Patterns

### 1. Extract-Before-Mutate Pattern
Used when complex data is needed during mutation operations:
```rust
let (data1, data2, data3) = {
    // Extract all needed data in immutable scope
};
// Use extracted data in mutable scope
```

### 2. Split Collection-Mutation Pattern  
Used for iterative updates with dependencies:
```rust
// Phase 1: Collect data/events
let events = collection.iter().map(|item| process(item)).collect();
// Phase 2: Apply mutations using collected data
for event in events { apply_mutation(event); }
```

### 3. Pre-Calculation Pattern
Used to separate expensive calculations from mutation operations:
```rust
let pre_calculated_values = expensive_calculation();
// Later: use pre_calculated_values during mutations
```

### 4. Strategic Split Borrowing
Used for dual access patterns:
```rust
let (left, right) = slice.split_at_mut(index);
// Safe simultaneous mutable access to different parts
```
