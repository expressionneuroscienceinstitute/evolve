//! # Physics Engine: Quantum Field Lattice Module
//!
//! This module provides a representation of a quantum field on a discrete lattice.
//! It's a foundational element for simulations involving quantum field theory (QFT),
//! such as lattice QCD. This implementation focuses on a simple scalar field.
