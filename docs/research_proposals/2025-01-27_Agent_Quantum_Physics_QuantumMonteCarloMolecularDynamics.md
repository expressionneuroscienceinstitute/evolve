## Problem Statement
The current molecular dynamics implementation in the EVOLUTION project uses classical force fields and approximations that fail to capture quantum mechanical effects crucial for accurate chemical simulations. This limitation affects:
- Bond breaking/formation dynamics
- Electron correlation effects in chemical reactions
- Zero-point energy contributions
- Tunneling effects in proton transfer reactions
- Electronic excited state dynamics

These quantum effects are essential for modeling complex chemical processes, catalytic reactions, and biological systems with the accuracy required for a comprehensive universe simulation.

## Background & Motivation
The EVOLUTION project currently has:
- Classical molecular dynamics with empirical force fields
- Basic quantum mechanics solver for atomic systems
- Quantum Monte Carlo methods implemented but not integrated
- Molecular dynamics bridge for atomic-to-particle conversion

However, there's a significant gap between the quantum physics engine and the molecular dynamics system. Chemical reactions, especially those involving bond formation/breaking, require quantum mechanical treatment of the electronic degrees of freedom. The current classical approach cannot capture:
- Quantum tunneling in hydrogen transfer reactions
- Electron correlation effects in transition states
- Zero-point vibrational energy contributions
- Electronic excited state dynamics
